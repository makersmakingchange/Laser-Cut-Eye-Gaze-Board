# Laser-Cut Eye-Gaze Board

## Overview
This repository contains cut files for creating a laser-cut eye gaze board. An Eye Gaze Communication Board, Gaze Communication Board, or Eye Communication Frame is a simple device to help someone communicate by interpreting eye movements. The eye gaze board is essentially a clear plastic sheet with a hole in the middle.

The Laser-Cut Eye Gaze Board is open assistive technology (OpenAT). Under the terms of the open source licenses, the device may be built, used, and improved upon by anyone.

<!--- The overall cost of materials is about $<MaterialCost> (plus $<ShippingCost> for component shipping). --->
